# ðŸŽ® Phaser Workshop

This project is an expanded curriculum based on the official Phaser tutorial, [Making Your First Phaser 2 Game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game).

It starts with an introduction to Phaser and the building blocks of the Web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to set the context of what students will learn in this workshop. After starting with the basics and getting a Phaser project setup, it progresses through the aforementioned tutorial with code samples and screenshots.

After completing a functional version of their first game, students are given the opprotunity to make the game their own with some ideas on how to personalize their creation. Additional resources are also provided for students to work on if they have extra time, or to continue learning at home.
