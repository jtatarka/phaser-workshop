      <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Phaser</span></li>
        <img class="icon" src="https://phaser.io/images/img.png">
        <p>From its <a href="http://phaser.io" target="_blank">Web site</a>, "Phaser is a fun, free and fast 2D game
          framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile web browsers, supporting Canvas and WebGL rendering."
        </p>
        <p>In other words, Phaser is a toolbox that developers can use to create all kinds of online games. It provides
          a starting point so that we can begin designing and building without having to write a lot of foundational
          code.</p>
        <li><span class="bold">HTML5</span></li>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. Using tags, HTML specifies the
          content and structure of a webpage which web browsers use to render its substance.</p>
        <p>HTML5 is the latest standard that defines HTML which aims to allow developers to create more advanced Web
          sites. Phaser exploits the HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag to create images to be used for online games.
        </p>
        <li><span class="bold">CSS</span></li>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style Web pages. Rather than focusing on content like HTML, CSS
          specifies how a Web page should look using various definitions which are applied using selectors.</p>
        <p>We won't be using CSS heavily in this workshop, however its good to know for context.</p>
        <li><span class="bold">JavaScript</span></li>
        <p>JavaScript is the de facto scripting language of Web pages. Though lightweight, it is extremely powerful and
          capable of controlling the behavior of Web pages or running many non-browser environments.</p>
        <p>We'll be programming our games in this workshop using JavaScript and the Phaser framework.</p>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="mint">Working with Thimble</h2>
      <img class="icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Mozilla_Thimble_logo.png">
      <p>Thimble is an online editor created by Mozilla which can be used to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. We'll use Thimble
        to create and host our Phaser games within the Cloud (meaning it's available from any computer with no need to
        install any software) for free.</p>
      <h3>Creating an Account</h3>
      <p>Follow these directions to get setup with a Thimble account of your own:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, go to <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org" target="_blank">thimble.mozilla.org</a> and click on
          "Create an
          account".</li>
        <li>Enter your desired username, a valid email address, and a password.</li>
        <li>Create a new project and get started with help from the default template, or remix <a
            href="https://thimbleprojects.org/jtatarka/481862" target="_blank">this project</a> which includes the
          boilerplate
          code needed to start a new Phaser 2 game.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Remixing</h3>
      <p>Thimble allows you to remix any project that is published on thimbleprojects.org. This means you can take a
        copy of the code, edit it within your own account, and republish a new version of the same application. To remix
        a project, just click on the "Remix" button from any Thimble site.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/remix.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Publishing</h3>
      <p>When you're ready to share your work, from any Thimble project's editor, click on "Publish" in the upper
        right-hand corner. Enter a brief description of your project, then click on "Publish" again and your application
        will be created and hosted. Once completed, you'll be presented with a link that you can share with family and
        friends.</p>
      <h3>Previewing</h3>
      <p>When working on a site using Thimble it may or may not be useful to have the preview auto refresh. When working
        directly with HTML and CSS this works really well, however with some JS applications, such as ones made with
        Phaser, it might be better to manually refresh after you've completed a method or other update. You can toggle
        between these two modes by checking or unchecking "AUTO" at the top of the editor.</p>
      <h3>Debugging</h3>
      <p>As with any coding project, you're bound to run into some issues and bugs while you're developing your Phaser
        game. Luckily, Phaser has console logging which helps us identify issues in code, and Thimble has a built in
        console to display these messages when using the editor. You can reveal it at anytime by clicking on the console
        icon at the bottom right of the preview panel.</p>
      <p>For more advanced debugging, you can use Chrome's Developer Tools (press <code>F12</code> to open, then click
        on the Sources tab). Dev Tools lets you set breakpoints in your code and watch variables at different times
        during code execution to help identify, troubleshoot, and fix bugs.</p>
    </div>

    <div calss="section">
      <h2 class="mint">A Bit More Detail</h2>
      <p>Although Phaser makes it easy for us to jump right in and get started with building online games, there is a
        little bit of setup required. First, we need to create a basic HTML page for our game to live in, maybe set a
        few basic styles, and definitely import the Phaser library, which is packaged up nicely in a
        <code>.min.js</code> file.</p>
      <p>After remixing the boilerplate project, you'll see the basic HTML structure for our application in
        <code>index.html</code>. HTML is uses tags to organize the content of a Web page, and a barebones page will be
        formatted like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs html">&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!-- Header content goes here including metadata, CSS and JS imports --&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/phaser/2.2.2/phaser.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- Everything in here is not shown in the browser's view --&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- Content to be displayed goes here, structured using various HTML tags --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Our body is empty other than a script we'll write to create our game --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> above includes a <code>script</code> tag to import <code>phaser.min.js</code> and
        a <code>link</code> to connect our CSS file. You might notice that all of the tags above have an associated tag
        of the same type with a <code>/</code> before it to close out that block of code, except for <code>link</code>.
        Most tags in HTML require both an opening and closing tag, though not all do, and those are known as
        self-closing.</p>
      <p>The <code>link</code>ed <code>styles.css</code> includes all of our CSS rules which the browser will use to
        style our page. Take a look at this file and you'll see this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs css">body {
  margin: 0;
}</code></pre>
      <p>All CSS rules are formatted like this. First we have a selector, in this case <code>body</code> and then any
        number of styles to be applied to the elements in our HTML file which match the selector. In this case a
        <code>margin</code> of <code>0</code> will be applied to our entire page.</p>
      <p>This selector selects on a particular element directly, but we can also match <code>id</code>s and
        <code>class</code>es. Any one HTML page should only have one of any given unique <code>id</code>, but may have
        any number of elements with a given <code>class</code> applied. For example, look at this HTML snippit:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs html">&lt;span id="welcome"&gt;Welcome to My Web Page!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class="orange"&gt;This is a paragraph with some information.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>To select the <code>id</code> we need to use a <code>#</code> before the name, and for <code>class</code>es we
        use a <code>.</code> like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs css">#welcome {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.orange {
  color: orange;
}</code></pre>
      <p>But the boilerplate project sets all of this up for us and we won't be focused on either HTML or CSS for this
        workshop. The important part is the Phaser library, which is written in JS. We'll be writing our own JS script
        using Phaser's code to help us out.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is technically a multi-paradigm language, meaning it can support different styles of coding. Often
        JS libraries take an object oriented (OO) approach, and this includes Phaser. The Phaser library specifies many
        different objects, or classes, each with their own variables and methods. Variables can also be described as
        properties, and methods as functions. In the games we create we'll see lines of code like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">player.animations.add('left', [0, 1, 2, 3], 10, true);</code></pre>
      <p>In this code, <code>player</code> is an object of type <code>Phaser.Sprite</code>, which has a property called
        <code>animations</code>, which happens to be another object (nesting these two is called composition) of type
        <code>Phaser.AnimationManager</code>. Then <code>Phaser.AnimationManager</code> has a method called
        <code>.add()</code> which contains the logic to <code>add</code> an animation to the manager of the
        <code>Sprite</code>. You can diferentiate properties from methods by looking for parentheses.</p>
      <p>Any things within the parenteses of a method are called parameters, but note that some methods do no require
        parameters. In the example above, <code>.add()</code> takes four parameters of various types, which are used
        within the logic of the method. The first is a string (a collection of characters <em>strung</em> together, the
        next an array (a data structure), then an integer, and finally a boolean (<code>true</code> or
        <code>false</code>).</p>
      <p>On a very high level, to make a Phaser game we'll first create a new <code>Phaser.Game</code> object, and then
        fill in three of Phaser's essential methods: <code>.preload()</code>, <code>.create()</code>, and
        <code>.update()</code>.</p>
      <p>The <code>.preload()</code> function is used to load any assets the game needs, like images, before building
        the entire game. Next, <code>.create()</code> creates the actual pieces of the game which will be displayed in
        the viewport. Then finally, <code>.update()</code> is a loop which is called on repeat to rerender the screen.
        We'll add interactions to this method and tell Phaser what we want the game to do when different things happen.
      </p>
      <p>You'll see each of these topics in more detail throughout the workshop. But one additional thing to note about
        Phaser: it's on a coordinate plane that might be orientied differently than expected. The x-axis is positive in
        the right (east) direction, and the y-axis is positive in the <em>downward (south)</em> direction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="mint">Getting Started with Phaser</h2>
      <p>To get started, we'll be follwing an adaptation of the official Phaser tutorial <a
          href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game" target="_blank">"Making your first Phaser
          game"</a>, which is available directly from <a href="http://phaser.io" target="_blank">phaser.io</a>. Note
        that we'll be using Phaser CE (Community Edition; also known as Phaser 2) for this workshop, but Phaser 3 has
        recently been released and has the same tutorial for the new, completely rewritten framework available <a
          href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game" target="_blank">here</a>. It's still a work
        in progress, however.</p>
      <h3>Step 0 - Boilerplate</h3>
      <p>All Phaser games start by creating an instance of the <code>Phaser.Game</code> object, typically called
        <code>game</code> by convention. You can call this varible anything you'd like, but can you really think of a
        better name for it?</p>
      <p>Remix <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/jtatarka/481862" target="_blank">this project</a>, or copy the code
        below
        into an existing Web page to get started with any new Phaser game.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, '', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });

function preload() {

}

function create() {

}

function update() {

}</code></pre>
      <p>Line 1 creates this local variable called <code>game</code> and assigns the object to it for later use. The
        <code>new</code> keyword creates a new object with the given parameters, which are the five variables inside the
        parentheses.</p>
      <p>The first two parameters are the width and height of your game. We're using <code>800</code> and
        <code>600</code> by default, but you can create a game of any size you like.</p>
      <p>The third parameter is the rendering context. It's a good idea to always use <code>Phaser.AUTO</code> as it
        will determine which option is best for the user's system: either <code>Phaser.WEBGL</code> or
        <code>Phaser.CANVAS</code>, which are the only other two valid choices for this parameter.</p>
      <p>Next up is the element of the Web page in which your game will live. By specifying an empty string
        (<code>''</code>) we'll append to the page's <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Finally, the fifth parameter is an
        object which maps our references to Phaser's essential functions.</p>
      <h3>Step 1 - Loading Assets</h3>
      <p>The <code>preload()</code> function is automatically called by Phaser when the game starts. The application
        will look to this function and load any assets, such as sprites and sprite sheets, which are defined within it.
      </p>
      <p>We will load our assets to our game using <code>game.load</code> and the <code>.image()</code> and
        <code>.spritesheet()</code> methods, as appropriate for each type of asset:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function preload() {

    game.load.image('sky', 'assets/sky.png');
    game.load.image('ground', 'assets/platform.png');
    // ...
    game.load.spritesheet('dude', 'assets/dude.png', 32, 48);

}</code></pre>
      <p>The code above adds three images to our game and one spritesheet. The first two parameters specify the asset
        key, used to identify the asset in subsequent lines of code, and the resource location.</p>
      <p>After <code>load</code>ing the <code>'ground'</code>, add one more <code>image</code> named <code>'star'</code>
        from the resource <code>'assets/star.png'</code>.</p>
      <p>Note that <code>.spritesheet()</code> has two additional parameters: the width and height of each frame in the
        sheet, plus an optional fifth parameter which will tell Phaser how many frame to use from the sheet if there are
        any empty frames at the end.</p>
      <h3>Step 2 - Create a Sprite</h3>
      <p>Now that we've loaded some assets, let's turn them into a sprite so we can use them in our game. Sprites should
        be <code>added</code> to the <code>create()</code> function of our application, and will look like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function create() {
        
  game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'sky');
  
}</code></pre>
      <p>Now you should have a nice gradient that will serve as the background for our game! Behind the scenes, Phaser
        created a new <code>Phaser.Sprite</code> object and <code>add</code>ed it to the game world, where all the
        objects will live.</p>
      <h3>Step 3 - World Building</h3>
      <p>The game world in Phaser is infinite and expands in all directions on a coordinate plane. The origin,
        <code>(0, 0)</code>, is automatically placed at the upper left corner of a new game for reference. We'll add
        some platforms to our newly created world that are character can run and jump on.</p>
      <p>First, create a new variable called <code>platforms</code>. Then, within the <code>create()</code> functions
        add in the Physics system and initialize a group which will contain the ground and two ledges:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var platforms;
        
function create() {

  // Add the Arcade Physics system to the game world
  game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);

  game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'sky');

  // Initialize a group called platforms
  platforms = game.add.group();

  // Enable physics for all objects within the platforms group
  platforms.enableBody = true;

}</code></pre>
      <p>To create the ground and ledges, create new variables and use <code>platforms.create()</code> to add them to
        the group in the correct position. Note that we can use <code>game.world.height</code> to get the height of the
        game world, like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var ground = platforms.create(0, game.world.height - 64, 'ground');

ground.scale.setTo(2, 2);

ground.body.immovable = true;</code></pre>
      <p>Following the same format, add two ledges to the <code>platforms</code> group. One should be on the right of
        the viewport, and the other on the left. When finished you'll have a world in which your character can move
        around.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/part4.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Step 4 - Sprite Sheets</h3>
      <p>Our sprite sheet from Step 2 was loaded with a different method because sprite sheets are not images. They
        differ because a sprite sheet is made up of animation frames, not a single picture. If you didn't take a look at
        the <code>'dude'</code> asset before, here's what he looks like:</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/dude.png">
      </div>
      <p>You'll notice that the sprite sheet has nine frames: one in the middle for when he's not moving and facing the
        camera, and two sets of four frames to either side for when he's running to the left and right.</p>
      <p>To add him to the game world, create a new variable called <code>player</code>, then reference this code:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">// Add the player and its settings
player = game.add.sprite(32, game.world.height - 150, 'dude');

// Enable physics on the player
game.physics.arcade.enable(player);

// Set the player's physics properties
player.body.bounce.y = 0.2;
player.body.gravity.y = 300;
player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;

// Add two animations to get him walking to the left and right
player.animations.add('left', [0, 1, 2, 3], 10, true);
player.animations.add('right', [ ... ], 10, true);</code></pre>
      <p>First, we'll add a sprite with three parameters. To see what these parameters are, take a look at the official
        <a href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.2.2/Phaser.GameObjectFactory.html#sprite" target="_blank">Phaser
          documentation</a>. Next, enable Arcade physics on the player and set the related properties:
        <code>bounce</code>, <code>gravity</code>, and <code>collideWorldBounds</code>.</p>
      <p>Finally, we'll add two animations which will make him move. The first one is completed for you, and the
        parameters, in order, are: a <code>name</code> for the animation, the <code>frames</code> from the sprite sheet
        to use in the animation, the desired <code>frameRate</code>, and a boolean which signifies that the animation
        should be repeated on a <code>loop</code>. This method is also fully documented <a
          href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.2.2/Phaser.AnimationManager.html#add" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Can you complete the <code>'right'</code> animation with the correct <code>frames</code>?</p>
      <h3>Step 5 - More on Physics</h3>
      <p>We've already specified that our game will use the <code>Physics.ARCADE</code> system and enabled it on all of
        our sprites and groups. For the <code>playforms</code> we used <code>enableBody</code>, and for our
        <code>player</code> we <code>enable</code>d <code>arcade</code>, and doing so gave our objects an instance of <a
          href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.2.2/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body.html"
          target="_blank"><code>ArcadePhysics.Body</code></a>.</p>
      <p>For example, when creating our player, we added the line <code>player.body.gravity.y = 300;</code>, which sets
        the local gravity, or how fast he'll fall. <code>300</code> is an arbitrary number, but the higher this value,
        the faster he'll come down while jumping or falling from <code>platforms</code>.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/part5-1.png">
      </div>
      <p>But you might have noticed that when he falls he's not landing on the ground, but rather on the edge of the
        world. Try commenting out the line with <code>collideWorldBounds</code> and see what happens to our
        <code>dude</code>.</p>
      <p><code>Physics.ARCADE</code> also allows us to check collisions of any body in the game world. Add back the line
        we just commented out so he can't leave the frame, and then insert the following line into the
        <code>update()</code> function:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function update() {

  var onPlatform = game.physics.arcade.collide(player, platforms);
  
}</code></pre>
      <p>This function is called by the game engine for every frame and the <code>.collide()</code> function will check
        to see if the <code>player</code> and <code>platforms</code> have collided, or touched. If they have, it will
        stop them from overlapping, and this is how we can get the <code>dude</code> to land on the ground and ledges
        without falling to the bottom of the game world.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/part5-2.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Step 6 - Keyboard Controls</h3>
      <p>Great, now our <code>dude</code> is able to land correctly, but he also can't yet move, so let's fix that! One
        way we can control characters using Phaser is with arrow keys. To do this, all we have to do is add a new
        variable and create a <code>cursors</code> object.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var cursors;

function create() {

  // ...

  cursors = game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();

}</code></pre>
      <p>Calling <a href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.2.2/Phaser.Keyboard.html#createCursorKeys"
          target="_blank"><code>.createCursorKeys()</code></a> returns an object with four properties for each arrow
        key: <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>. With just one line of code
        we can easily <code>update()</code> the location of our <code>player</code>.</p>
      <p>Now that we have access to keyboard controls, we need to add in some logic to move the <code>'dude'</code>
        around:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function update() {

  // ...

  // Reset his velocity in the x-axis
  player.body.velocity.x = 0;

  // Conditional statements to move him side to side
  if (cursors.left.isDown) {

    // Move him to the left
    player.body.velocity.x = -150;
    player.animations.play('left');

  } else if (cursors.right.isDown) {

    // Move him to the right
    player.body.velocity.x = 150;
    player.animations.play('right');

  } else {

    // Make him stand still
    player.animations.stop();
    player.frame = 4;

  }</code></pre>
      <p>Awesome, now our little <code>'dude'</code> can move around to the left and to the right. But can he hop onto
        one of the ledges? Nope, not yet. If you're thinking we can use <code>cursors.up</code> to make him jump, you're
        absolutely right!</p>
      <p>Let's add a new conditional check to make him jump, as follows:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">if (cursors.up.isDown && onPlatform && player.body.touching.down) {

  // Make him jump up
  player.body.velocity.y = -350;

}</code></pre>
      <p>The second and third checks here make sure that he is touching one of the platforms, as we (probably) don't
        want him to get an extra boost when he's already jumping or on top of some other object.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/part7.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Step 7 - Collecting Stars</h3>
      <p>Mr. <code>'dude'</code> seems a little lonely, doesn't he? Let's give him a purpose! We'll drop some stars into
        the game world and let him collect them. Just as with the <code>platforms</code>, we can <code>add</code> a
        <code>group()</code> and then <code>create()</code> several objects in it.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var stars;

function create() {

  // ...

  stars = game.add.group();

  stars.enableBody = true;

  // Create 12 stars as part of the stars group
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) {

    // Space them evenly (70px) apart
    var star = stars.create(i * 70, 0, 'star');
  
    // Apply gravity and a slightly random bounce
    star.body.gravity.y = 300;
    star.body.bounce.y = 0.7 + Math.random() * 0.2;
  
  }</code></pre>
      <p>If you run the code, you might notice a problem. Just as we did with the <code>player</code> and
        <code>platforms</code>, we need to <code>.collide()</code> the <code>stars</code> and <code>platforms</code> so
        the <code>stars</code> don't fall through.</p>
      <p>Next we can have our <code>'dude'</code> collect the <code>stars</code> using the <code>.overlap()</code>
        method:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">game.physics.arcade.overlap(player, stars, collectStar, null, this);</code></pre>
      <p>You can probably tell what <code>player</code> and <code>stars</code> mean here, but what about
        <code>collectStar</code>? This third parameter is a callback function which gets invoked when the two previous
        parameter overlap. The fouth parameter, <code>null</code> is another callback function that lets you make
        additional checks before calling the first callback, and finally <code>this</code> is a reference to the
        context. Don't worry so much about the latter parameters; the first three are most important for us, but if you
        want to learn more, check out the <a href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.2.2/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.html#overlap"
          target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
      <p>But more on that callback function; we need to create it! Outside of the existing three functions, add:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function collectStar(player, star) {

  // Remove the star from the game world
  star.kill();

}</code></pre>
      <p>A note about the parameters here: Phaser is smart enough to automatically send them to our callback function
        since it knows we're checking if the <code>player</code> and <code>star</code> have overlapped.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/part8.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Step 8 - Keeping Score</h3>
      <p>So now we have a fully functional game, but let's take it one set further and keep score based on how many
        <code>stars</code> the <code>player</code> has collected. We can do this two two extra variables: one to keep
        track of the score, and one to display it:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">// Initalize score to zero
var score = 0;

// Initalize Phaser.Text object to display the score
var scoreText;</code></pre>
      <p>Then let's setup the <code>scoreText</code> (think about where this should go):</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">scoreText = game.add.text(16, 16, 'Score: 0', { fontSize: '32px', fill: '#000000' });</code></pre>
      <p>If you're wondering what the first two parameters here mean, change them up and see what happens. The third
        parameter is the <code>string</code> of text we'll be adding, and the last one inside <code>{ }</code> is an
        object used to style the text.</p>
      <p>After fully initializing <code>scoreText</code> we need to update it when a <code>star</code> is collected. We
        can piggy back off of our callback function to do this since both actions will happen at the same time:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function collectStar(player, star) {

  // ...

  score += 10;
  scoreText = 'Score: ' + score;

}</code></pre>
      <p>And there you have it, a fully functional Phaser game! Test it out and make sure your score is correctly
        incremented with each <code>star</code> that you collect.</p>

      <h2 class="mint">Making It Your Own</h2>
      <h3>Add Your Personal Style</h3>
      <p>Put the finishing touches on your game by updating its look!</p>
      <p>Do a Google image search for a new background or texture to use for the <code>platforms</code>, or search
        through some of the sites in the References below. Upload your new images to Thimble and update your JS code to
        use them.</p>
      <p>You can also style the rest of your Web page, since a plain white background is boring. First, add a new HTML
        element to your page with an <code>id</code>. We'll use this element to append the game to, rather than
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs html">&lt;div id="game"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>Then update your <code>game</code> variable with the same <code>id</code> as the constructor's fourth
        parameter. From here, you're ready to apply CSS styling to the game's viewport. Just setup some rules in
        <code>styles.css</code> using the <code>id</code> as your selector:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs css">#game {
  border: 10px solid white;
  margin: 50px auto;
  width: 800px;
}</code></pre>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/stylecapture.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Change the Collected Item</h3>
      <p>The <code>assets</code> folder contains lots of additional sprites you can add to your game. Try to change the
        collected item from a <code>star</code> to a <code>diamond</code> or one of the colored <code>ball</code>s. Note
        that these assets have different widths and to make them evently spaced out you might need to adjust the
        location of where they get created. Also, you can add more than <code>12</code> items - try doubling that number
        or making a hundred!</p>
      <p>Bonus: use all of the <code>ball</code> assets in your <code>for</code> loop to create items of different
        colors. Can you come up with a good way to iterate though each color to minimize the amount of duplicated code?
      </p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/itemscapture.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Go Crazy with Platforms</h3>
      <p>Make your game more challenging by adding additional ledges to the <code>platforms</code> group. Put them at
        different locations around the game world and use <code>scale.setTo()</code> to adjust the height and width of
        each one. With the proper parameters, can you turn a ledge into a pillar that the <code>player</code> will need
        to jump over?</p>
      <p>Also try setting <code>body.immovable = false;</code> and see what happens to the <code>ground</code> or
        <code>platforms</code>. If you remove some <code>stars</code> you may be able to allow the <code>player</code>
        to only jump on a ledge once.</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/platformscapture.png">
      </div>
      <h3>Take It to the Next Level with Sound</h3>
      <p>Images and sprite sheets aren't the only kind of assets that Phaser will let you <code>load</code>; you can
        also <code>add</code> sound to your games as background music or effects when some action occurs. The
        boilerplate project contains a few clips to get you started, including one called <code>key.wav</code>, which
        can be added to your game like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">var sound;

function preload() {

  // ...

  game.load.audio('sound', 'assets/key.wav');

}

function create() {

  // ...

  sound = game.add.audio('sound');

}</code></pre>
      <p>Then your sound is ready to use whenever you need it with just one additional line:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">sound.play();</code></pre>
      If you wanted to play this <code>sound</code> when an item was collected, where could this line be added to the
      game?
      <h3>Pick a New Sprite Sheet</h3>
      <p>From a game design perspective, it's really important to carefully think about the characters you want to
        introduce into your game world. Picking the right ones will give a unique feel to your game and have a big
        impact on your users' overall experience.</p>
      <p>Included in the Phaser Boilerplate project is another sprite sheet called <code>puppy.png</code> that we can
        use:</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <img src="assets/puppy.png">
      </div>
      <p>This sprite sheet is more complicated than <code>dude.png</code> for a few reasons: there are more frames to
        choose from, including a blank one at the end, and they're all facing to the right. But we can make it work!</p>
      <p>First, let's change our code from <code>'dude'</code> to <code>'puppy'</code>. We'll need to change the last
        line of <code>preload()</code>, to rename the asset, its location, and the size of each frame.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function preload() {
  
  // ...

  game.load.spritesheet('puppy', 'assets/puppy.png', ..., ...);

}</code></pre>
      <p>Open the asset in the Thimble editor to see the size of the sprite sheet. How can you determine the height and
        width of each frame with this information?</p>
      <p>Next, update the <code>player</code> declaration in <code>create()</code> so we reference the correct asset. It
        just so happens that using frames <code>[5, 6, 7, 8]</code> works well for this sprite sheet too, so let's try
        it out and see what happens.</p>
      <p>With just those few changes, making the <code>'puppy'</code> move to the <code>'right'</code> works quite well,
        but things get weird when we go to the <code>'left'</code>. Update the frames in the <code>'left'</code>
        animation to match those in the <code>'right'</code> and we get a pretty close. But he's still not facing the
        correct direction.</p>
      <p>How can me make the <code>'puppy'</code> not moonwalk? Luckily Phaser can help us flip the sprite sheet. To do
        this, first add an <code>anchor</code>, and then adjust the <code>scale</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs js">function update() {

  // ...

  player.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);

  if (cursors.left.isDown) {
    player.scale.x = -1;
    // ...
  } else if (cursors.right.isDown) {
    player.scale.x = 1;
    // ...
  }

  // ...

}</code></pre>
      <p>Setting the <code>anchor</code> places an imaginary point in the middle of the sprite sheet that Phaser will
        use to flip the image over, creating an axis in both dimentions. Then, when the user presses the left arrow key
        we'll flip the image, and likewise flip it back to the original orientation when the right arrow key is pressed
        down.</p>
      <p>One final improvement could be to update the default frame to number <code>5</code>, but can you think of ways
        to use some of the other frames that are in the sprite sheet?</p>
